# Security and permissions

Glossa connects one project folder to an authenticated client through a local worker. The worker performs file operations and, only in `system` mode, local commands. The relay routes requests while the worker is online; it does not store a repository copy.

## Access profiles

| Profile | Read files | Change files and paths inside the project | Run commands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `read-only` | Yes | No | No |
| `workspace` (default) | Yes | Yes | No |
| `system` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

The selected profile appears in the local terminal and in `list_devices`. Both the relay and the local worker enforce it.

> **`system` is powerful and is not sandboxed.** Commands run with the full environment, credentials, filesystem permissions, and network access of the operating-system account that started Glossa. Commands are not confined to the selected project and can affect local or external systems.

## What Glossa enforces

- Structured file tools stay inside one selected root and reject absolute paths, parent traversal, and linked-path escapes. Workspace mode can create directories, move files or directories, and delete paths without enabling commands.
- File changes require `workspace` or `system`; commands require an explicit `system` session.
- OAuth, account scoping, device credentials, and HTTPS protect the relay connection.
- The hosted relay keeps account, device, routing, and metadata-only audit records. It does not durably store file contents, command arguments, command output, environment variables, tokens, or local absolute paths.
- The local worker keeps command state only transiently. Default command responses remain bounded; when output is truncated, up to 1 MiB of stdout and 1 MiB of stderr can be read back in bounded ranges without rerunning the command. Terminal command records last no more than five minutes, at most eight recent records are kept, and retained output is deleted with its record.
- Press Ctrl+C or `q` in the worker terminal to disconnect immediately.

## Sensitive data

The public Glossa app is not intended for payment-card data subject to PCI DSS, protected health information, government identifiers, access credentials, or authentication secrets. Keep these categories out of the exposed project.

Glossa blocks recognizable authentication-secret patterns in text inputs and results, including every retained command-output range. This can prevent common accidental disclosures, but it is not a complete data-loss-prevention system or sandbox. Unknown, encoded, encrypted, fragmented, or transformed values may not be recognized, and a command can send data over the network without printing it.

When credentials must be unreachable, run `system` in a credential-free dedicated operating-system account, container, or virtual machine with only the project and tools it needs.

## Safer use

- Start with the default `workspace` mode for ordinary code changes, directory creation, moves, and scoped deletions.
- Use `read-only` for inspection when no edits are needed.
- Enable `system` only for a task that needs the local toolchain.
- Expose a narrow project, never a home directory, filesystem root, credential store, or secrets directory.
- Stop the worker if the activity shown in the terminal is unexpected.

## Report a security issue

Do not publish credentials, private source code, exploit details, or personal data. Use the [private security reporting process](https://github.com/ariobarin/glossa/security/advisories/new). See [support](/support) if private reporting is unavailable.
