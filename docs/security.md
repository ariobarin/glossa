# Core security and threat model

How Glossa protects local workspaces, accounts, credentials, and data.

## Security boundary

Each worker exposes one canonical local directory and one access profile:

| Profile | Structured reads | Guarded mutations inside root | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `read-only` | Yes | No | No |
| `workspace` (default) | Yes | Yes | No |
| `system` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

The selected profile is visible in the local terminal and returned by `list_devices` as both a profile and exact permission booleans. The relay rejects an operation outside that profile before queueing it. The local worker independently performs the same check before reading, writing, or starting a process. This defense in depth protects against relay mistakes, stale clients, protocol skew, and attempted bypasses through direct worker traffic.

A worker from an older release that did not declare a profile is reported as `system`, because that release historically accepted commands. Compatibility never understates legacy authority.

## Warning about system access

`system` access is explicit remote command authority for the operating-system account that launched Glossa. A command inherits that process's complete environment, credentials, filesystem permissions, and network access. It starts in the exposed root but is not confined there. File-tool containment does not sandbox commands, and command filtering is not presented as a security boundary.

Use the default `workspace` profile when file changes, directory creation, deletion, or moves inside the exposed root are sufficient. Enable `system` only when the requested task genuinely requires the local toolchain. Use a dedicated operating-system account, container, or virtual machine when stronger isolation is required.

## Trust assumptions

- The Glossa operator controls the hosted relay and identity provider.
- The authenticated user intends to authorize the connected MCP client.
- The local computer and selected operating-system account are trusted for the chosen profile.
- There is no hostile multi-tenant execution inside one local worker process.
- TLS termination, OAuth token validation, and deployment secrets are correctly configured.
- The user understands that `system` is broader than the exposed file root.

## Primary assets

- Local source code and project data.
- Local developer credentials, environment, tools, and network identity.
- Device credentials and ephemeral worker credentials.
- OAuth refresh and access tokens.
- Account, device, worker, and job ownership relationships.
- Command details, command results, and file contents in transit.

## Primary threats and controls

### Cross-account routing

**Threat:** an authenticated account guesses another account's device, worker, command, or job identifier.

**Controls:**

- include `account_id` in all primary and foreign-key relationships;
- validate JWT signature, issuer, audience, expiry, required scope, and explicit Auth0 provider-prefix and exact-subject allowlists;
- require account ID in every database and in-memory ownership lookup;
- never fetch by resource ID and check ownership afterward when an account-scoped query is possible;
- use opaque random identifiers;
- bind local device credentials to the authenticated subject before reuse;
- bind ephemeral worker credentials to one account, device, worker ID, and generation;
- verify account isolation with direct integration checks before deployment.

### Stolen device token

**Threat:** a device token is used to enroll or operate workers for the affected account.

**Controls:**

- generate a 256-bit random secret;
- transmit it only over HTTPS;
- store only a salted scrypt hash in the relay database;
- display or return the raw secret once;
- store it locally in the operating-system credential store, with an explicit warning before a restricted file fallback;
- support device-specific revocation;
- apply failed-authentication rate limiting and constant-time comparison;
- never log Authorization headers.

A device token does not silently broaden a worker's selected access profile. The relay and worker still enforce that profile for every operation.

### Stolen worker token

**Threat:** an active worker credential is replayed against relay worker endpoints.

**Controls:**

- create an independent 256-bit random secret for each worker generation;
- bind it to one account, device, worker ID, and generation;
- store only its SHA-256 digest in relay process memory;
- invalidate it on reconnect, unregister, device revocation, or liveness expiry;
- reject mismatched worker IDs and generations;
- transmit it only over HTTPS and never log Authorization headers;
- keep the access profile in relay-side worker state and enforce it before queueing work.

### Malicious or compromised MCP client

**Threat:** an authenticated client requests destructive, overbroad, secret-seeking, or unrelated actions.

**Controls:**

- require explicit OAuth authorization and the `glossa:access` scope;
- publish accurate MCP tool schemas, output contracts, side-effect annotations, and use/disallow descriptions;
- tell the model not to use Glossa for general questions, web research, built-in ChatGPT tasks, credential inspection, or work unrelated to the local workspace;
- expose only one narrow root per worker and reject implicit home or filesystem-root exposure;
- let the user select `read-only`, `workspace`, or explicit `system` authority at startup;
- enforce the selected authority in both the relay and local worker;
- treat startup as authorization only for operations inside the selected profile, without claiming per-command local confirmation;
- show the selected profile and compact write or command activity locally;
- provide visible status, immediate disconnect, logout, and device revocation;
- treat all file and command output as untrusted data rather than instructions;
- reject recognizable authentication secrets in mutation and command inputs before relay dispatch, and suppress recognizable credential material before file or command results leave the worker.

### Permission downgrade or metadata mismatch

**Threat:** the relay, model, documentation, or local worker disagrees about the authority of an online workspace.

**Controls:**

- use one protocol enum and one permission-mapping function across the CLI and relay;
- include the profile in current worker registration and echo it in the registration response;
- expose the profile and derived booleans through `list_devices`;
- reject writes and commands before relay dispatch when permission is absent;
- reject the same operations again inside `LocalWorker`;
- return stable, actionable `write_access_disabled` and `command_access_disabled` errors that tell the model not to retry or bypass the boundary;
- classify profile-less legacy workers as `system` rather than assuming a safer state;
- cover all profiles at the CLI, relay, MCP, and local-worker test layers.

### Path escape

**Threat:** absolute paths, parent traversal, symlinks, junctions, case aliases, or writable ancestors escape the structured file root.

**Controls:**

- enforce canonicalization, realpath, symlink, junction, and reparse-point checks for the host operating system;
- validate existing paths and nearest writable ancestors locally;
- reject absolute paths and lexical parent escapes;
- revalidate root-relative paths for every structured file operation, including directory creation, deletion, and moves;
- reject deleting or moving the exposed root, reject existing move destinations and self-nesting directory moves, and require an explicit recursive flag before deleting non-empty directories;
- stream directory entries into bounded traversal state, skip links and unavailable files during listing and search, and cap entries, files, bytes, matches, lines, returned content, and elapsed local scan time;
- preserve discovered native filenames; prefix POSIX names containing literal backslashes with `./` so they remain safely reusable, and normalize returned separators only on Windows;
- preserve correct case-sensitive or case-insensitive comparison for the host;
- verify Windows junction and reparse-point behavior and POSIX symlink behavior whenever path enforcement changes.

### System-command authority

**Threat:** a system-profile command reads secrets, modifies resources outside the root, reaches the network, or affects an external service.

**Reality:** these are possible consequences of the explicitly selected `system` profile, not capabilities of structured file tools. Glossa preserves arbitrary project command execution because using the existing local toolchain is a core function, but it does not describe that authority as sandboxed.

**Controls and limits:**

- make `workspace`, not `system`, the default;
- require the user to start `glossa --access system` explicitly;
- disclose inherited environment, credentials, filesystem permissions, and network access in CLI help, HUD, quickstart, terms, security pages, MCP instructions, tool descriptions, and reviewer material;
- tell the model not to use commands for general web research, credential or environment inspection, or bypassing structured file-tool boundaries;
- reject recognizable authentication-secret inputs at the relay and worker;
- scan file results, edit diffs, command-output chunks, and every retained output range locally; retain bounded overlap across chunks, clear captured and retained output, terminate the process tree, and return only `restricted_data_blocked` when a match is detected;
- never enumerate, persist, or log environment variables automatically;
- keep default command snapshots bounded; cap each retained range at 64 KiB, each retained stream at 1 MiB, terminal records at five minutes, and recent command records at eight; also bound command duration, concurrency, and status waits;
- terminate the process tree on cancellation, timeout, worker shutdown, or disconnect;
- make cancellation disclosure accurate: stopping a process does not undo prior local or external effects;
- recommend a dedicated OS account, container, or VM for unattended or sensitive use.

The authentication-secret detector is deliberately high-confidence. It does not recognize every custom, encoded, encrypted, compressed, fragmented, or transformed value, and it cannot prevent a command from sending data directly to the network. Detection can occur only after earlier command effects. The detector is defense in depth, not a sandbox, complete data-loss-prevention system, or substitute for a credential-free runtime. Public submission remains gated by the decision in [Restricted authentication data review](restricted-data.md).

### Restricted Data in tool traffic

**Threat:** a tool input, file result, edit diff, or command stream contains payment-card data subject to PCI DSS, protected health information, a government identifier, an API key, password, MFA or OTP code, access token, private key, or other authentication secret.

**Architectural limit:** the implemented detector addresses recognizable authentication secrets only. It does not attempt to classify arbitrary text as PCI data, PHI, or a government identifier. A user-selected file may contain those categories before any general local-file bridge can know what it contains. The public submission gate in [Restricted Data review](restricted-data.md) therefore applies to all access profiles.

**Controls:**

- reject recognizable secret-bearing structured mutation paths plus `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `run_command` inputs in the relay before queueing a worker job;
- repeat input checks locally so older or compromised relay behavior cannot bypass the worker boundary;
- preflight an edited file before mutation and bind the edit to the scanned SHA-256 when the caller did not already provide one;
- inspect content-bearing file results, command snapshots, and every retained command-output range before they leave the worker;
- inspect command output incrementally with overlap across chunks so a token split across writes is still detected;
- clear captured and retained output, stop the command process tree, and return a fixed safe error without the matched value;
- redact restricted command inputs from local activity events;
- permit explicit placeholders such as `<redacted>` and `replace-me` so documentation and fixtures remain usable;
- test the detector against the repository corpus to prevent ordinary source code from becoming unreadable.

**Limits:** the worker necessarily handles local bytes while deciding whether to block them, unknown formats can evade recognition, and a command can transmit data without printing it. The only dependable boundary against those cases is an isolated credential-free account or runtime with enforceable filesystem, agent, metadata-service, and network restrictions.

### Logging leakage

**Threat:** source code, command details, output, paths, tokens, or identities reach platform logs or durable audit storage.

**Controls:**

- record structured operational metadata only;
- redact headers and bodies;
- never attach request or response content to logs;
- never add local absolute paths or path-derived repository names to relay metadata or logs;
- retain an optional workspace label only when the user supplies it explicitly and only for the active worker lifetime;
- omit file contents, command arguments, output, environment variables, and bearer tokens from durable audit events;
- verify log scrubbing before deployment.

### Relay compromise

**Threat:** an attacker controls the routing service or its process memory.

**Controls and limits:**

- the relay does not possess local repository clones or durable developer credentials;
- device or worker credentials can issue jobs while an authorized worker is exposed, so relay compromise remains serious;
- relay-side profile enforcement reduces accidental overreach, while local enforcement remains authoritative against a forbidden operation;
- minimize dependencies and privileges;
- use managed platform patching, exact dependencies, secret scanning, short-lived worker credentials, and rapid device revocation;
- keep production content out of logs and durable routing state.

A fully malicious relay can still send any protocol job to a connected worker. The local profile boundary prevents a read-only or workspace worker from executing a command, but a `system` worker intentionally retains broad command authority. Stronger protection requires running that worker inside an isolated OS account, container, or VM.

## Data retention

Durably retain only what is needed for account, device, and security operation:

- device ID, user-supplied name, platform, created, last-seen, and revoked timestamps;
- OAuth subject identifier;
- metadata-only audit event type, status, and timestamp;
- optional request timing events limited to a bounded operation label, HTTP status, and duration, with no identifiers, paths, arguments, output, tokens, or request bodies.

Do not durably retain:

- file content;
- command input or output;
- environment variables;
- full local paths;
- repository names unless explicitly supplied as an ephemeral label;
- OAuth, device, or worker bearer secrets;
- reviewer passwords or other portal credentials.

Additional defenses must extend these controls rather than replace them.
