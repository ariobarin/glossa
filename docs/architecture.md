## Why the relay stays small

The relay must be publicly reachable, while the user's computer makes outbound connections only. One hosted relay process supplies the rendezvous point and OAuth-protected MCP endpoint. Postgres stores identity and lifecycle metadata. Active routing state remains in memory.

Users do not operate networking, identity, or database infrastructure.

## Identity planes

### MCP client identity

The authorization server handles discovery, login, consent, and access tokens. The relay validates issuer, audience, expiry, and the `glossa:access` scope. It atomically creates an account for a new authenticated subject and rejects accounts marked disabled.

The managed service accepts only Auth0 subjects from the Google social connection. The relay enforces the configured subject prefix in addition to JWT validation, so enabling another connection in Auth0 does not grant it Glossa access. Self-hosted relays explicitly select their own allowed Auth0 subject prefix.

### CLI user identity

The published CLI uses OAuth Device Authorization Flow. Its embedded client ID is public. The CLI requests `openid profile offline_access glossa:device`.

The managed Auth0 Google connection requests Google's account chooser on every new authorization. This lets a user choose among multiple Google accounts instead of silently reusing a browser session.

### Worker device identity

After user login, the CLI calls the device-enrollment API. The server returns a device token once:

```text
gld_<device-id>_<random-256-bit-secret>
```

The database stores the device ID, account ID, salt, and scrypt hash. Worker requests authenticate the device token over HTTPS. One device can be revoked without affecting the user's other devices or MCP authorizations.

## State ownership

### Postgres

- accounts
- devices and revocation
- device names
- schema migrations
- metadata-only audit events

The canonical database schema is [`apps/relay/sql/001_init.sql`](../apps/relay/sql/001_init.sql). Every resource lookup includes the authenticated account ID.

### Relay memory

- active worker connections
- device IDs and connection generations, without local absolute paths
- pending jobs
- request waiters
- recent nonces and bounded rate-limit counters

### Worker

- exposed canonical root
- path enforcement
- local process execution
- complete inherited local environment and developer credentials
- temporary active command state

## Hosted request deadlines

The hosting layer imposes a bounded request window. Therefore:

- worker long polls return within 20 seconds;
- worker poll wait time is reduced by authentication time so the complete request remains bounded;
- `run_command` returns after the worker accepts the command and supplies a command ID;
- command execution continues locally beyond the initiating request;
- `get_command` may wait up to 15 seconds, and `cancel_command` uses a separate bounded request;
- no hosted request remains open for the lifetime of a command.

The core protocol uses ordinary MCP tools for command start, status, result, and cancellation. Native MCP Tasks support is deferred until target clients support it dependably.

## Deployment scale

Use exactly one relay process while active routing state is process-local. Do not scale horizontally until routing has an external coordination design.

## Local development

Local development may use loopback relay and worker origins. It must still exercise OAuth authentication and the same account and device ownership checks as production.
